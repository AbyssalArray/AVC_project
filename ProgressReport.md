# Project Analysis

## What went according to plan? What did not?
Something that went to plan was that everyone so far has chipped in and completed a significant chunk of their designated work. This has allowed us as a group to progress at a rate that is on track with how we planned it. Although specific aspects of the plan have been completed ahead or behind schedule, the time taken on tasks has balanced itself over the progression of the project.

Something that was unexpected was that our Software Architect completed most of his allocated tasks well ahead of schedule. This could be attributed to the Project Manager assigning tasks too conservatively, or the Software Architect working extremely quickly. Either way, the bulk of the code was written in a small amount of time. Therefore, an improvement we could have made in the planning process was to allocate more tasks to each individual.

Something else that was not according to plan was that we did not expect the code to not compile for so long. This made our Project Designer's role difficult, as he could not test the code easily if it would not run. The reason for this problem was that the nature of the project meant that the code was difficult to get started, as there were a lot of constants and methods that needed to be set up and working before the robot could even move, or travel along line. To remedy this, we could have had more detailed planning, including some more pseudocode or flow charts in the design process to make the code compile quicker.
