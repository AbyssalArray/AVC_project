# Installation Guide
To install, download the repository as a .zip file and unzip the folder in the desired location. You will need a C++ compiler. Launch the move_demo.cpp file in your IDE of choice and build the file. Run the resulting move_demo.exe file to run the program. If you would like to view the robot and camera image feed while the program is running, open the m1.bmp and m2.bmp files.
